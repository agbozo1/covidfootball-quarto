Match Operations\n\n![source: https://unsplash.com/\\@viennachanges](images/vienna-reyes-Zs_o1IjVPt4-unsplash.jpg){fig-alt=\"empty stadium - source: unsplash\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nOne of the most immediate effects of COVID-19 on the EPL was the absence of crowds during matches. The 2020-2021 season saw teams playing behind closed doors, which altered the traditional home advantage that teams typically enjoy due to supportive fans. Research indicated that teams reliant on home support, such as Liverpool and Manchester United, were disproportionately affected by this change. The lack of crowd presence not only influenced the atmosphere but also had measurable effects on team performance metrics like goals scored and overall match outcomes (@thakur2023).\n\n#### 2. **Financial Impact**\n\n![source: https://unsplash.com/\\@antenna](images/antenna-cw-cj_nFa14-unsplash.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe pandemic also raised critical questions regarding the financial sustainability of football clubs. A study analyzing EPL revenues found that television revenues were the primary income source for clubs, followed by matchday and commercial revenues. The pandemic led to predictions of significant reductions in player salaries and market values due to decreased revenues, with estimates suggesting declines of 20% to 26% in player salaries and market values for the 2020-2021 season (@quansah2021). This financial strain highlighted vulnerabilities within the football business model, particularly for clubs that depended heavily on matchday income.\n\n#### 3. **Grassroots Football**\n\n![source: https://unsplash.com/\\@acrehuet98](images/adria-crehuet-cano-LIhB1_mAGhY-unsplash.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWhile elite professional leagues like the EPL received attention and support during the pandemic, grassroots football faced severe challenges. The pandemic's impact on local communities was profound, as many grassroots clubs struggled without financial assistance, leading to concerns about their long-term viability. The focus on elite football often overshadowed the needs of community-level clubs that play a crucial role in local engagement and well-being (@grassroots19).\n\n## 2020/21 Season in Review\n\nAfter obtaining dataset of games played during the lockdown season, its time to explore briefly some interesting facts through analytics.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n##### Goals Scored per Club (Table)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 20 × 2\n   Club                    SeasonGoals\n   <chr>                         <int>\n 1 Manchester City                  82\n 2 Manchester United                70\n 3 Tottenham Hotspur                66\n 4 Liverpool FC                     65\n 5 Leicester City                   64\n 6 Leeds United                     60\n 7 West Ham United                  60\n 8 Chelsea                          56\n 9 Arsenal                          53\n10 Aston Villa                      52\n11 Southampton                      47\n12 Everton                          45\n13 Newcastle United                 44\n14 Brighton                         39\n15 Crystal Palace                   39\n16 Wolverhampton Wanderers          34\n17 West Bromwich Albion             33\n18 Burnley                          32\n19 Fulham                           26\n20 Sheffield United                 19\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Goals Scored in per Club (Pie Chart)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](covid-football-epl_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Top Scorer Leaderboard - Goal Contributions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                    Name                 Club Nationality Position Matches GA\n1             Harry Kane    Tottenham Hotspur         ENG       FW      35 37\n2        Bruno Fernandes    Manchester United         POR       MF      37 30\n3          Mohamed Salah         Liverpool FC         EGY       FW      37 27\n4          Son Heung-min    Tottenham Hotspur         KOR       FW      37 27\n5            Jamie Vardy       Leicester City         ENG       FW      34 24\n6        Patrick Bamford         Leeds United         ENG       FW      38 24\n7        Marcus Rashford    Manchester United         ENG       FW      37 20\n8          Ollie Watkins          Aston Villa         ENG       FW      37 19\n9        Kevin De Bruyne      Manchester City         BEL       MF      25 18\n10         Sadio Man\\xe9         Liverpool FC         SEN       FW      35 18\n11       Raheem Sterling      Manchester City         ENG       FW      31 17\n12         Callum Wilson     Newcastle United         ENG       FW      26 17\n13       Matheus Pereira West Bromwich Albion         BRA    MF,FW      33 17\n14       Roberto Firmino         Liverpool FC         BRA       FW      36 16\n15         Jack Harrison         Leeds United         ENG       MF      36 16\n16 Dominic Calvert-Lewin              Everton         ENG       FW      33 16\n17         Jack Grealish          Aston Villa         ENG    FW,MF      26 16\n18            Danny Ings          Southampton         ENG       FW      29 16\n19     ?lkay G\\xfcndo?an      Manchester City         GER       MF      28 15\n20          Riyad Mahrez      Manchester City         ALG       FW      27 15\n21       Michail Antonio      West Ham United         ENG       FW      26 15\n22   Alexandre Lacazette              Arsenal         FRA       FW      31 15\n23  Raphael Dias Belloli         Leeds United         BRA       MF      30 15\n24     James Ward-Prowse          Southampton         ENG       MF      38 15\n25            Chris Wood              Burnley         NZL       FW      33 15\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](covid-football-epl_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Minutes Played vs. Goals Scored (Players with less than 10 starts)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](covid-football-epl_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, COVID-19 has had a multifaceted impact on English football, particularly within the EPL. The absence of fans altered match dynamics and team performance, while financial pressures raised concerns about sustainability across all levels of football. Additionally, grassroots football faced significant challenges that could affect community engagement long after the pandemic subsides.\n\n<p class=\"left-txt\">Research Text Prepared in Collaboration with <a href='https://www.perplexity.ai/' target='_blank'>Perplexity</a></p>\n",
