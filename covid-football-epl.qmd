## Lockdown Football

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted English football, particularly the [English Premier League (EPL)](https://www.premierleague.com/), in various ways, including match operations, financial stability, and team performance.

#### 1. Match Operations

One of the most immediate effects of COVID-19 on the EPL was the absence of crowds during matches. The 2020-2021 season saw teams playing behind closed doors, which altered the traditional home advantage that teams typically enjoy due to supportive fans. Research indicated that teams reliant on home support, such as Liverpool and Manchester United, were disproportionately affected by this change. The lack of crowd presence not only influenced the atmosphere but also had measurable effects on team performance metrics like goals scored and overall match outcomes (@thakur2023).

#### 2. **Financial Impact**

The pandemic also raised critical questions regarding the financial sustainability of football clubs. A study analyzing EPL revenues found that television revenues were the primary income source for clubs, followed by matchday and commercial revenues. The pandemic led to predictions of significant reductions in player salaries and market values due to decreased revenues, with estimates suggesting declines of 20% to 26% in player salaries and market values for the 2020-2021 season (@quansah2021). This financial strain highlighted vulnerabilities within the football business model, particularly for clubs that depended heavily on matchday income.

#### 3. **Grassroots Football**

While elite professional leagues like the EPL received attention and support during the pandemic, grassroots football faced severe challenges. The pandemic's impact on local communities was profound, as many grassroots clubs struggled without financial assistance, leading to concerns about their long-term viability. The focus on elite football often overshadowed the needs of community-level clubs that play a crucial role in local engagement and well-being (@grassroots19).

## 2020/21 Season in Review

After obtaining dataset of games played during the lockdown season, its time to explore briefly some interesting facts through analytics.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
epl = read.csv("data/EPL_20_21.csv", encoding='WINDOWS-1252')
```

##### Goals Scored per Club (Table)

```{r}
total_goals <- epl %>% select(Club, Goals, Assists) %>%
  group_by(Club) %>%
  summarise(SeasonGoals = sum(Goals)) %>%
  arrange(desc(SeasonGoals))
total_goals
```

##### Goals Scored in per Club (Pie Chart)

```{r}
ggplot(
  total_goals,
  aes(x="", y=SeasonGoals, fill = Club)
) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) + coord_polar("y", start = 0) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#233354", "#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#fc0341","#18d644","#d1cea7","#c3371a",
                             "#cc3b92", "#99cc3b", "#2468ab", "#e3b791", "#d83ae0","#3ae0bc","#851f1c","#e6e215",
                             "#f2839f","#ae83f2","#2a5c43", "#85099e"))+
  #theme(plot.title = element_text(vjust = 0.5)) +
  geom_text(colour="white", aes(label = SeasonGoals, x = 1.3),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(x=NULL,
       y="Goals")
```

##### Top Scorer Leaderboard - Goal Contributions

```{r}
top_players_GA <- epl %>%
  mutate(GA = Goals + Assists) %>%
  select(Name, Club, Nationality, Position, Matches, GA) %>%
  top_n(GA,n=20) %>%
  arrange(desc(GA))
top_players_GA$Name <- enc2utf8(as(top_players_GA$Name, "character"))
print(top_players_GA)
```

```{r}
ggplot(top_players_GA, aes(Club, Matches, size = GA)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 280, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.3)) +
  geom_point()
```

##### Minutes Played vs. Goals Scored (Players with less than 10 starts)

```{r}
less_10_goals = ggplot(
  epl %>% filter(Starts<10, Goals > 0),
  aes(
    x = Mins,
    y = Goals,
    color = xG
  )
) + geom_point()

less_10_assists = ggplot(
  epl %>% filter(Starts<10, Goals > 0),
  aes(
    x = Mins,
    y = Assists,
    color = xA
  )
) + geom_point()

gridExtra::grid.arrange(
    less_10_goals,
    less_10_assists,
    ncol = 2
)
```

#### Conclusion

In summary, COVID-19 has had a multifaceted impact on English football, particularly within the EPL. The absence of fans altered match dynamics and team performance, while financial pressures raised concerns about sustainability across all levels of football. Additionally, grassroots football faced significant challenges that could affect community engagement long after the pandemic subsides.
